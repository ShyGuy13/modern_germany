 bookmark_new_germany_desc:0 "Germany is composed of 16 federal states, or Bundesländer, each with its own constitution, government, and responsibilities. These states vary significantly in size, population, and economic strength, reflecting Germany's diverse cultural and historical heritage. The largest state by area is Bavaria in the southeast, while North Rhine-Westphalia in the west is the most populous. States like Saxony and Thuringia in the east have seen significant development since reunification. Hamburg, Bremen, and Berlin are city-states, each combining the roles of city and state government. Historically, this federal structure reflects Germany's origins as a patchwork of independent kingdoms, duchies, and free cities within the Holy Roman Empire."
