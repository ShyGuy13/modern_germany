 bookmark_new_germany_desc:0 "The German Empire, under the rule of Kaiser Wilhelm II, has emerged as the dominant power in Europe. With the unification of the German states under Prussian leadership, the Empire has become the most powerful state on the continent. The Kaiser has embarked on a policy of Weltpolitik, seeking to establish Germany as a global power. The Empire has a large and well-equipped army, and a rapidly expanding navy. However, the rise of Germany has alarmed the other great powers, and the Empire faces many challenges in the years ahead."
